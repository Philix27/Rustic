In Rust, there are differences between string literals and String objects.

1. **String Literal (`let b = "Jake";`)**:
   - String literals are stored in the program's binary and are immutable.
   - They have a known size at compile time and are statically allocated.
   - They are accessed directly from the binary where the program is compiled.
   - They are of the `&str` type, which is a reference to a string slice.

2. **String Object (`let d = String::from("Jake");`)**:
   - String objects (`String`) are mutable and are stored in the heap.
   - They have a flexible size and can grow or shrink in memory.
   - They are created using the `String::from` function, taking a string slice (`&str`) as an argument.
   - They are of the `String` type, which is a heap-allocated string.

Comparing the two:

- `b` is a string literal. It is immutable and statically allocated.
- `d` is a `String` object. It is mutable and heap-allocated.

Here's a comparison in usage:

```rust
fn main() {
    let b = "Jake"; // This is a string literal (&str)
    let d = String::from("Jake"); // This is a String object

    println!("{}", b); // Printing a string literal
    println!("{}", d); // Printing a String object

    // You can't modify a string literal directly (immutable)
    // b.push('!'); // This line would cause a compilation error

    // But you can modify a String object (mutable)
    let mut mutable_string = String::from("Hello");
    mutable_string.push_str(", world!");
    println!("{}", mutable_string); // Prints: Hello, world!
}
```

Remember, Rust treats these differently due to their memory storage and mutability characteristics.
